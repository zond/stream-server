//! `SSL_CERT_DIR` out from under the process for a moment, and the enginefs

/// On Linux `rustls-platform-verifier` loads the system store through
/// `rustls-native-certs`, which takes the store from `SSL_CERT_FILE` and
/// `SSL_CERT_DIR` when either is set. Pointed at an empty file and an empty
/// directory it loads nothing, and `Verifier::new` refuses an empty store
/// ("No CA certificates were loaded from the system"), so a builder that
/// constructs it cannot `build()`. Ours builds anyway, which is only
/// possible if it never asked the platform for roots.
